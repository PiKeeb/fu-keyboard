**FU!Keyboard** (**Functionally Ultimate Keyboard** or **FUK** for short) is the hotswappable 26x7 ortholinear behemoth of a keyboard with small 0.91" 128x32 OLED display, 4 independent rotary encoders and addressable RGB per-key illumination.

FUK sports the memory-rich **Atmel AT90USB1286** MCU for the native QMK and VIA(L) support (and with that many keys you are gonna need a whole lotta memory for a whole lotta macros, extra keystrokes and all sorts of stuff).

## Features:
1. **Atmel AT90USB1286-MU** MCU with 128 kB of programmable memory
2. **182 MX-type Switches** arranged in full 26x7 ortholinear matrix
3. **Kailh CPG151101S11** hotswappable sockets
4. **SSD1306 0.91" 128x32 OLED** display
5. **4 independent EC11** rotary encoders with switches
5. **182 SK6812MINI-E (or a-likes) addressable RGB LEDs** for per-key illumination
6. **Gasket-mounted case** with unique 1.5 degree typing angle
7. Uses [**ao03-2725's Unified Daughterboard**](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard)
