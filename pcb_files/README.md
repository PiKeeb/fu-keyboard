## Possible issues with powering SK6812MINI-E

There are ***182*** SK6812MINI-E RGB LEDs on the PCB that might trip the USB over-current protection on your PC. In that case, it's recommended to lower the maximum brightness of the LEDs **AND** to use the powered USB hub.

It's also possible to power the LEDs using the separate power adapter. To do that, you are going to need **5V 40W (8A)** power supply with the **Barrel jack (OD 4.5mm, ID 1mm, positive polarity)**.

You also need to cut the **JP1** jumper on the back of the PCB in order to use the power adapter:

After that's done you can plug the power adapter:
